                    <p>"Writing and Digital Media" sounded like the methodology and approach of writing online journalism. In retrospect, my presumption couldn't have been further from the truth. Granted that's probably a slight overstatement, my mental compass was certainly pointing my expectations in the wrong direction when I arrived to the first day of class. Fortunately, this new direction revealed a more beautiful horizon: HTML.</p>

                    <p>Like the most new concepts to me, coding didn't sound too achievable or learnable. In fact, before this class, I thought coding was secluded for those ingenious hackers you see in the movies opening maximum-security doors from their bedroom closets.
                    <img src="images/giphy.gif" syle="width:360px;height:250px"/>
                    <p>However, I was pleasantly surprised to learn that coding HTML was extremely intuitive and understandable. Despite having only scratched the surface, I am already familiar with many of the tools and abilities that HTML provides. For example, before this class, I didn't know where to begin to create a webpage, let alone uploading a GIF. Now, I can perform both these tasks with somewhat effortlessness. But don't be fooled by this impressively professional coding; there were many learning curves I had to overcome. </p>

                    <p>With the help of Lynda.com, the Internet, and class, this feature became second nature; now, I can't stop doing it! GitHub stood as the second trial of this module. Accompanied with Atom, this program seemed to add on one more too many moving parts to coding. At first, it seemed like too confusing of a step just to save my work somewhere else. But I quickly learned and reaped the benefits of the server which now hosts this masterpiece.</p>

                    <p>The second part of this class slightly diverged from HTML. In our podcast and video projects, we focused on a topic we had researched in class before: VT-Shaped Student. These assignments were extremely helpful to my overall understanding of the concept which, before, simply sounded like any other hypothetical idea to advance education. After completing both assignments, I gained experience by explaining an abstract topic in relatively concrete fashions. However, both projects required a lot of brainstorming to create a clever outline. Nonetheless, at the end of the day, I have more tools under my belt to creatively communicate an idea to an audience, which will be very handy in the future.</p>

                    <p>Lastly, I would like to address the website redux which includes my rap about VT-shaped students, an extension of the T-shaped one. I believe it is a perfectly applicable idea for a school like this. However, my rap touches upon the academic major "hierarchy" at Virginia Tech. Some majors don't necessarily see the point of liberal education and vice versa. In order to implement this plan, the university will have to create a way to effectively get students to see the valid use in both practical and liberal learning. For students like me, with disciplinary skills in journalism and writing, I know that Virginia Tech is already equipping me with integrated abilities that will further me in an increasingly technological world.</p>
