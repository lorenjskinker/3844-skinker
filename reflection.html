                    <p>"Writing in the Digital Media" sounded like the methodology and approach of writing online journalism. In retrospect, my presumption couldn't have been further from the truth. Granted that's probably a slight overstatement, my mental compass was certainly pointing my expectations in the wrong direction when I arrived to the first day of class. Fortunately, this new direction revealed a more beautiful horizon: HTML.</p>

                    <p>Like the most new concepts to me, coding didn't sound too achievable or learnable. In fact, before this class, I thought coding was secluded for those ingenious hackers you see in the movies opening maximum-security doors from their bedroom closets.

                    <br>
                    <p>However, I was pleasantly surprised to learn that coding HTML was extremely intuitive and understandable. Despite having only scratched the surface, I am already familiar with many of the tools and abilities that HTML provides. For example, before this class, I didn't know where to begin to create a webpage, let alone uploading a GIF. Now, I can perform these tasks with somewhat effortlessness. But don't be fooled by this impressively professional coding; there were many learning curves I had to overcome. </p>

                    <p>My greatest struggle in HTML thus far was learning how to input images. The function seemed to require a coding fluentness that that I was just beginning to speak. Before this, I had only created simple text on a naked, whitewashed webpage. To me, it was like attempting to have a full-on Spanish conversation with only knowing, "Me llamo Loren".</p>

                    <br>
                    <p>With the help of Lynda.com, the Internet, and class, this feature became second nature; now, I can't stop doing it! Another trial during this module was GitHub. Accompanied with Atom, this program seemed to add on one more too many moving parts to coding.  </p>

                    <p> The modular readings have provided a new perspective and appreciation for what I'm doing in class. To know that I'm working with the very idea that Berners-Lee planted at CERN twenty-seven years ago is somewhat incredible –– how far technology has come is even more so.
