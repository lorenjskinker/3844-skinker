                    <p>"Writing and Digital Media" sounded like the methodology and approach of writing online journalism. In retrospect, my presumption couldn't have been further from the truth. Granted that's probably a slight overstatement, my mental compass was certainly pointing my expectations in the wrong direction when I arrived to the first day of class. Fortunately, this new direction revealed a more beautiful horizon: HTML.</p>

                    <p>Like the most new concepts to me, coding didn't sound too achievable or learnable. In fact, before this class, I thought coding was secluded for those ingenious hackers you see in the movies opening maximum-security doors from their bedroom closets.

                    <p>However, I was pleasantly surprised to learn that coding HTML was extremely intuitive and understandable. Despite having only scratched the surface, I am already familiar with many of the tools and abilities that HTML provides. For example, before this class, I didn't know where to begin to create a webpage, let alone uploading a GIF. Now, I can perform these tasks with somewhat effortlessness. But don't be fooled by this impressively professional coding; there were many learning curves I had to overcome. </p>

                    <p>My greatest struggle in HTML thus far was learning how to input images. The function seemed to require a coding fluentness that that I was just beginning to speak. Before this, I had only created simple text on a naked, whitewashed webpage. To me, it was like attempting to have a full-on Spanish conversation with only knowing, "Me llamo Loren".</p>

                    <p>With the help of Lynda.com, the Internet, and class, this feature became second nature; now, I can't stop doing it! GitHub stood as the second trial of this module. Accompanied with Atom, this program seemed to add on one more too many moving parts to coding. At first, it seemed like too confusing of a step just to save my work somewhere else. But I quickly learned and reaped the benefits of the server which now hosts this masterpiece.</p>

                    <p> The modular readings have also provided a new perspective and appreciation for what I'm doing in class. To know that I'm playing with the very idea that Berners-Lee planted at CERN twenty-seven years ago is somewhat mind-blowing –– how far technology has come since then is even more so. Additionally, I have realized the copyright ramifications that HTML brought, and how much it shook the world of "free" online capitalism. In a way, it is humbling and exciting to know the extent of what has and can be achieved through HTML coding.</p>

                    <p>Lastly, I would like to address the VT-shaped student, an extension of the T-shaped one. I believe it is a perfectly applicable idea for a school like this. Known for being a reliable powerhouse of technological advances and inventions, Virginia Tech has an opportunity to strike the perfect balance between practical and liberal education, especially in the College of Liberal Arts and Human Sciences. For students like me, with disciplinary skills in journalism and writing, I know that Virginia Tech is already equipping me with integrated abilities that will further me in an increasingly technological world.</p>
